/*
You recently started working in the IT department of a large store. You were put in charge of the inventory database availableItems, which has the 
following structure:

id: unique item ID;
item_name: the name of the item;
item_type: the type of the item.
Note that it is possible for items that are of different types to have the same names.

One of the most common operations performed on this database is querying the number of specific items available at the store. Since the database is quite 
large, queries of this type can take up too much time. You have decided to start analyzing this problem by counting the number of each available item.

Given the availableItems table, write a select statement which returns the following three columns: item_name, item_type and item_count, containing the 
names of the items, their types, and the amount of those items, respectively. The output should be sorted in ascending order by item type, with items of 
the same type sorted in ascending order by their names.

*/

CREATE PROCEDURE solution()
BEGIN
	/* Write your SQL here. Terminate each statement with a semicolon. */
	select item_name, item_type, count(id) as item_count
	from availableitems 
	group by item_name, item_type
	order by item_type asc, item_name asc;
END
